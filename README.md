* #BSC MATHEMATICS_Aspiring Data Scientist *
{ A results-driven individual who has recently completed my BSc Physical Science Degree in Mathematics and 
Chemistry from the University of Johannesburg. As a proactive, determined, and enthusiastic individual, I pride 
myself on my ability to solve problems and am determined to succeed in all that I do. 
I enjoy having to prepare and solve any challenges presented and would thrive working in a competitive, fast 
paced environment, one where learning is encouraged, and failure is not feared and were knowledge flows 
dynamically among employees. 
With a keen interest in problem-solving and analytical thinking, I aim to be able to grow an end-to-end knowledge 
of data pipeline, to have an all-inclusive knowledge of data processes. 
I am currently seeking an opportunity that will help me to gain experience, acquire professional knowledge, and 
grow within the industry. I aim to draw on my experience and knowledge gained to add value to any organisation 
I represent.}
